# Archive-iOS

This repository is a collection of various Swift and iOS projects that we find valuable to keep around outside of our active codebases.

Code that lives in this repository might include:

- Proof of concept projects we decided not to move forward with.
- Deprecated libraries and/or applications that we found valuable to open-source.
- Code we wrote that got Sherlocked.

All code in this repository is provided as-is and without support or warranty. You might find little or no documentation or flat-out broken, non-compiling code. Due to this lack of support, issues and pull requests for this repository will remain closed, but all code is made available under the MIT license.
